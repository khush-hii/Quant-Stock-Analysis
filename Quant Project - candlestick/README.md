Stock Prediction Web Application
This project implements a Stock Prediction system that uses technical indicators and machine learning models to analyze historical stock data and predict potential buy/sell signals. The project is built with Flask for the web interface, Yahoo Finance API for fetching stock data, and Random Forest for machine learning-based prediction. The app also includes interactive visualizations powered by Plotly.

Features
Stock Data Fetching: Fetch historical stock data from Yahoo Finance.
Technical Indicators: Implements popular indicators such as SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD, and Bollinger Bands.
Machine Learning Prediction: Uses Random Forest for predicting stock price trends based on historical data.
Buy/Sell Signal Generation: Generates buy/sell signals based on the predictions and technical indicators.
Interactive Visualization: Displays stock data and indicators in an interactive graph using Plotly.
Web Interface: A simple and intuitive web interface built with Flask.
Tech Stack
Backend: Python, Flask
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, Random Forest
Data Handling: Pandas, Yahoo Finance API
Visualization: Plotly
Web Styling: HTML, CSS (Custom Styled)
Installation
1. Clone the repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-prediction.git
cd stock-prediction
2. Set up a Python virtual environment
If you don’t have a virtual environment, you can set it up using the following commands:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
3. Install dependencies
Install the required libraries using the requirements.txt file:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
1. Run the Flask Application
Start the Flask development server by running the following command:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
This will start the Flask web server locally. By default, it will be hosted at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

2. Open the web app in your browser
Navigate to the following URL in your browser:

arduino
Copy code
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
You’ll be greeted with a form where you can input:

Stock Ticker (e.g., AAPL, TSLA)
Start Date (e.g., 2021-01-01)
End Date (e.g., 2022-01-01)
3. View Results
After submitting the form, the app will:

Fetch stock data for the given ticker and date range.
Calculate technical indicators (SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands).
Use a Random Forest machine learning model to predict stock price trends and generate buy/sell signals.
Display the results in an interactive plot.

Modules Overview
1. app.py
This is the main Flask web application file. It handles user inputs from the HTML form, fetches stock data, calculates technical indicators, and generates the final results page with visualizations.

2. data_handler.py
This module uses the Yahoo Finance API to fetch historical stock data based on the stock ticker and date range provided by the user.

3. indicators.py
Calculates popular technical indicators like EMA, RSI, MACD, SMA, and Bollinger Bands to analyze the stock data.

4. signals.py
Generates buy/sell signals based on the technical indicators and machine learning model predictions.

5. backtester.py
Simulates how the stock strategy would have performed historically based on the user’s investment strategy and stock data.

6. visualizer.py
Generates interactive visualizations of the stock data using Plotly to show candlestick charts and overlaid indicators.

7. ml_model.py
Trains a Random Forest machine learning model to predict stock price trends. The model is trained using features like technical indicators and past price movements.

8. static/style.css
Custom CSS for styling the web pages, making the app visually appealing and user-friendly.

9. templates/index.html
The HTML form where users input the stock ticker, start date, and end date for analysis.

10. templates/results.html
Displays the results, including stock prediction, technical indicators, buy/sell signals, and an interactive visualization of the stock data.

Enhancements and Future Work
Additional Indicators: Implement more advanced technical indicators like Fibonacci Retracement, Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), etc.
More Machine Learning Models: Experiment with other machine learning models such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) for time-series predictions.
User Authentication: Implement user authentication so that users can save and track their investments.
Real-Time Data: Integrate real-time stock data fetching and updating.
Performance Metrics: Add performance metrics such as Sharpe Ratio, Max Drawdown, etc., to evaluate strategy performance.
